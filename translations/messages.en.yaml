    history:
        p1: "The Sylvestro Ganassi Library was founded in the early 1970s as a basic cultural support for the Association's activities."
        p2: 'Between 1977 and 1979, the initial collection focused on musical practice and didactics expanded toward a broader musicological orientation.'
        p3: "From the 1980s, the Association's official journal was first «Il flauto dolce», and then, from 1989, «Recercare», a journal that paid particular attention to organology (history and technology of musical instruments), a field usually neglected by other musicological journals. The Library followed this new direction, becoming the only one in Italy specifically dedicated to this discipline; all volumes and periodicals have been catalogued and inserted online by the Polo Capitolino in the OPAC SBN (National Library Service). The Ganassi Library participates in the SBN network of the Municipality of Rome, headquartered at the Biblioteca Romana dell'Archivio Storico Capitolino."

Rivista per lo studio e la pratica della musica antica»."
